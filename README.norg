* NVCode
  NVCode is my personal Neovim configuration. It is typically in the form of a Nix Flake, but this version will work anywhere Neovim works, probably. I haven't tested.

* Installation
  Simply copy the .config/nvim folder into your .config/nvim folder.

* License
  NVCode Non-Flake is licensed under the MIT License.
